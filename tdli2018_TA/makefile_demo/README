== Makefile demo ==

This is an annotated demonstration of how to structure your code into
modules, and how to use a Makefile to easily compile your code.

First, look at program.f90, and then hello.f90 and world.f90. Notice how
the code is structured into two modules which are then link to a main
program.

Next, look at Makefile, to see how you can easily compile your code with
a single command.

To try it out, run:
   make
which will produce the executable 'helloworld'

To run your freshly compiled program, run:
   ./helloworld
which should print some output.
